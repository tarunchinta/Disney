# Disney

## Introduction and Background
There is a large quantity of Disney movie datasets but they frequently contain null values and are not well structured. The intention of this project is to create a thorough Disney Movie Dataset so that analytical tools and machine learning models can be applied. Data was pulled from several sources and integrated into one dataset with interconnected tables.

## Features
**Data Lake**: Store unstructured and unconnected Disney data. <br>
**Data Warehouse**: Interconnected tables for structured data storage. <br>
**Airflow Pipeline**: Automate data ingestion, generation, cleaning, modelling, and a consumption layer to track changes to data. <br>
**Experimental Data Enrichment**: Scripts that fill null values using the Google Gemini Large Language Model. <br>
**Web Scraping**: Script using BeautifulSoup and requests to pull data from a Disney website. It is transformed into a Pandas Dataframe and merged with other Disney data. <br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explored which features contribute most significantly to  box office revenue of a movie and created plots with matplotlib. <br>

## Machine Learning Models
**Decision Tree** <br>
**Bagging** <br>
**Random Forest** <br>
**Gradient Boosting** <br>
